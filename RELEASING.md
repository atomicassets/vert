# Releasing @atomichub/vert

How a version of this package reaches npm and GitHub. A release ends at a
rendered GitHub Release, not at the npm publish.

## Checklist

1. The feature PR carries the `CHANGELOG.md` entry for the version under
   `## [X.Y.Z]`, written in the section shape below with H3 headings, and
   lands on `main`. The entry is the editorial text of the Release, so it is
   written once, in the PR that makes the change.

2. Land a `chore(release): X.Y.Z` commit on `main` that bumps the version in
   `package.json` and touches nothing else. Read the `CHANGELOG.md` entry
   against the template below now, because the next step publishes a tag.

3. Tag the release commit and push the tag:

    ```sh
    git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z
    ```

    `.github/workflows/publish.yml` starts; its build job runs the release
    gates (tag matches version, tag on main), the install, the tests, and
    packs the tarball; its publish job waits on the `npm-publish`
    environment. Push the tag before creating the Release, because
    `gh release create` resolves the tag rather than creating it. The tag is
    the release: consumers pin or float on it, so push it only once the entry
    and the code behind it are ready.

4. Compose the body, read it, then create the Release:

    ```sh
    scripts/release-notes.sh vX.Y.Z > notes.md
    gh release create vX.Y.Z --verify-tag --title vX.Y.Z --notes-file notes.md
    ```

    Add `--prerelease` for a candidate tag such as `vX.Y.Z-rc1`, so the
    candidate does not take the latest marker. With more than one release in
    flight, create them in ascending version order, so that marker stays
    monotonic.

5. Approve the `npm-publish` environment for the tag once the run is green
   through the build gates, the tag-on-main check included, which proves
   the tagged commit sits on `main`. With more than one release waiting,
   approve in ascending version order, so the npm `latest` tag stays
   monotonic.

6. Verify the published version and the rendered Release:

    ```sh
    npm view @atomichub/vert version
    gh release view vX.Y.Z
    ```

## Publish auth

The publish job authenticates through npm trusted publishing (OIDC). It holds
no npm token and sets no registry URL on the setup step, so nothing writes an
`.npmrc` auth entry and npm 11.5.1 or later exchanges the job's OIDC identity
for a short-lived credential of its own. The `npm-publish` environment is the
gate on that identity: the build job runs immediately on the pushed tag, and
the publish job waits until a maintainer approves it.

`publishConfig.provenance` in `package.json` makes a default local npm publish
fail, because no OIDC identity is available outside CI to satisfy it. It is
data inside the manifest being published, not an access control. The durable
control is the npm-side package setting that requires trusted publishing,
which is configured for `@atomichub/vert`.

## Body template

The Release title is the tag name verbatim. The body is an optional
one-sentence summary, then the sections that have items, then the commit list,
then the compare link as the last line. Nothing follows the link, and a
section with no items is left out.

```
<one-sentence summary, optional>

## Commits

- <short sha> <subject>

Full changelog: https://github.com/atomicassets/vert/compare/<PREV>...<TAG>
```

The section order is breaking changes, upgrading, features, bug fixes,
security, deprecations, other changes. `## Security` carries advisories and
dependency lifts, each naming its GHSA or CVE identifier; a release with none
leaves the section out.

## Voice

- Neutral and factual, the register of the Node.js or esbuild release notes.
- Sectioned. The heading says what kind of change it is, so the item does not
  repeat it.
- One to three plain sentences per item: what changed, and what the reader
  does about it when action is needed. Code identifiers in backticks.
- Every item ends with its PR reference `(#N)`, or with its short sha in
  backticks when the change had no PR.
- No preface, no motivation essay, no clause chain explaining how the author
  got there. The why stays only where it changes what the reader does.
- Present tense for the new behavior, sentence-case headings, straight quotes,
  and no em-dash.

## The CHANGELOG entry

`CHANGELOG.md` is where the editorial text is written, and the Release body is
that entry with its headings promoted one level. An entry heading is
`## [X.Y.Z]`. Under it comes an optional one-line summary, then the H3
sections in the order above. A candidate tag reads the entry for its base
version as it stands at that tag, so `vX.Y.Z-rc1` reads `## [X.Y.Z]`.

## Tag ranges and older releases

- `PREV` for a stable tag is the nearest earlier stable `v*` tag, so a stable
  release lists every commit since the last stable release and skips the
  prereleases between them. `PREV` for a prerelease tag is the nearest earlier
  tag of any kind. A stable tag whose only earlier tags are prereleases takes
  the nearest of them.
- `## Commits` lists the whole `PREV..TAG` range, oldest first, including the
  release commit. Its line count equals `git rev-list --count PREV..TAG`.
- `v2.1.1` is the upstream-base tag. It marks the last commit taken from
  upstream, where `package.json` still read `@waxio/vert`, and it carries no
  Release by design. `v2.2.0` bounds its commit range on it. No tag earlier
  than `v2.1.1` exists in this repository.
- A tag with no earlier tag has no `PREV`. Its body is the summary and the
  sentence `Initial release.`, with no commit list and no compare link, and it
  is written by hand.
- A Release created for a tag older than the current latest is created with
  `--latest=false`, so the latest marker stays on the newest version.

`scripts/release-notes.sh` needs bash, git, awk and sed. It reads
`CHANGELOG.md` at the tag rather than from the working tree, so the body
describes what the tag ships. A second argument names a ref to read instead:
`scripts/release-notes.sh vX.Y.Z main` composes the same body from `main`
before the tag exists, prints the range it used on stderr, and refuses the
preview once that ref already carries the tag.

The script exits non-zero and names what is missing when no tag is given, when
the tag is neither v-prefixed nor bare semver, when the tag does not exist and
no ref was passed, when the CHANGELOG at that point carries no entry for the
version, and when no earlier tag in the namespace is reachable.
`scripts/release-notes.test.sh` is its paired check, and CI runs it on every
push and pull request.

## Published package metadata

A release publishes a package page as well as a Release, and the page reads
`package.json`. It carries `name` and `version`; `description` (one sentence
on what the package does and for whom); `license`, with the `LICENSE` file
shipped; `homepage`; `repository` (an object with `type: git` and the
`git+https` URL); `bugs` (an object with the issues URL); `author` (an object
with `name` and `url`); `keywords`; `engines`; `main`, `types` and the
`exports` map; `files` (the build output and the notices that must ship);
`sideEffects`; and `publishConfig` with `access: public` and
`provenance: true`. The package ships a CommonJS build only, so there is no
`module` field and the `exports` map declares the one entry and its type
declarations.

The README is the npm page: it opens with the package name, badges for the npm
version, CI and license, a short introduction, and an install line. Upstream
and lineage credit lives there too, in the opening paragraph, so no Release
body carries a credits section.

`npm pack --dry-run` lists what the tarball ships: `dist` with its type
declarations and source maps, `src` excluding its `tests` directories,
`README.md`, `LICENSE` and `package.json`. `src` ships so the source maps
resolve, but its test sources do not: `files` in `package.json` excludes
`src/**/tests`. A spec file anywhere in the list, compiled or source, means an
exclude stopped matching, and anything else unexpected is a `files` mistake.
`scripts/packaging.test.sh` runs that check in CI, on every Node version in
the matrix, so the tarball is proven before the tag.
